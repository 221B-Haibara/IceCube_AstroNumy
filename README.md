The EHE-alert event IceCube-170922 has been followed up and observed by Fermi, magic, etc.
This package tries to calculate the p-value for the spaticial and timing significance of having such neutrino in the presense of a flaring blazer in the 3FGL catalogue.

steps:
1. random sampling of an EHE-alert neutrino from a flat prior distributed time range of T (9 years in the example)
2. record the zenith angle of the
